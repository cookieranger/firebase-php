The recommended way to install the Firebase PHP SDK is with
`Composer <http://getcomposer.org>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require kreait/firebase-php

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

.. code-block:: php

    require 'vendor/autoload.php';

You can find out more on how to install Composer, configure autoloading, and
